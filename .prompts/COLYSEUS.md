## Technical Architecture

### Server Components
- **Room Types**: Specialized Colyseus rooms for different use cases
- **Schema System**: Type-safe state synchronization using `@colyseus/schema`
- **Authority Management**: Server-authoritative logic with client prediction
- **Matchmaking**: Intelligent room assignment and load balancing
- **Persistence**: Optional state persistence for long-running sessions

### Client Components
- **Connection Manager**: Handles WebSocket connections and reconnection
- **Component Adapters**: Drop-in replacements for Needle's networking components
- **State Interpolation**: Smooth visual updates from network data
- **Ownership System**: Client-side ownership tracking and authority requests
- **Event System**: Custom event propagation and handling

### Integration Points
- **Unity Editor**: Seamless integration with existing Needle workflows
- **Component Generation**: Automatic TypeScript stub generation
- **Asset Pipeline**: Coordination of asset loading across clients
- **Debug Interface**: In-editor and runtime debugging tools

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] 100% compatibility with existing `SyncedTransform`, `SyncedRoom`, and `Networking` components
- [ ] Support for 4+ concurrent users per room with smooth performance
- [ ] Sub-100ms latency for transform updates in optimal conditions
- [ ] Automatic handling of network disconnections and reconnections
- [ ] Cross-platform support (desktop, mobile, WebXR)

### Performance Requirements  
- [ ] <50ms average network latency for local deployment
- [ ] 60 FPS maintained with 10+ networked objects
- [ ] <10MB memory overhead for networking layer
- [ ] Graceful degradation under poor network conditions
- [ ] Efficient bandwidth usage (<1KB/s per idle user)

### Developer Experience
